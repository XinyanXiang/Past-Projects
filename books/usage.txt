DESCRIPTION
     Books.py will search through the database by flags: it can search for 
     strings within titles, author names, or search for books published in 
     a year range. Only one of -t, -y, or -a can be used at a time. 
	
     Users can also view help and version statements. 

     The following options are available:



     -t --title     Search database for titles containing titleString
	     (case-insensitive), returning list of books sorted by title.
	     Search strings including space characters need to be surrounded
             By quotations. If no titleString provided, prints all books.

     -a --author    Search database for authors containing authorString
	     (case-insensitive), returning list of books sorted by surname,
	     ties broken by given name. Search strings including space 
	     characters need to be surrounded by quotations. If no authorString
	     provided, prints all authors. 

     -y --year      Search database for books published within year range,
	     inclusive, returning list of books sorted by publication year.
	     Range indicated by -s and -e flags. If no flags provided, will
	     print all books. Default values for -s is 0, and for -e is 
	     a very large integer. 

     -s --startyear Optional flag for -y, specifying start year. One integer
	     required. 

     -e --endyear   Optional flag for -y, specifying end year. One integer
	     required.

     It is an error for improper inputs, such as "abc" with the -y flag. 

     It is an error if no string follows -bs.

     Example code: python3 books.py -t "the" -bs year
                   python3 books.py -a "e"
                   python3 books.py -y -s 2010 -e 2020
